				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Code Room has been in existence for quite some time. It was intended to be, as the headline stated,<br />
&#8220;<em>A code snippet archive, how-i-did-its, some corny jokes and a look into the <strong>mind of recursion</strong>. I prefer lines of code to lines of blog text so this ride might be a little wild. Just come along though, and maybe we&#8217;ll see something great.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Some code did make it to the blog, which was then hosted on blogger, but it never did get the investment it deserved. For as long as I&#8217;ve known how to, I&#8217;ve been in love with writing code. The language was never an issue, and I&#8217;ve joked that I eat learning curves for breakfast. Something changed over the years though. Complacency set in, I continued to hack here and there, and the world moved ahead while my skills stayed a few paces back from where they could be.</p>
<p>This is the year I change that though, I will invest in my craft and I&#8217;ll share what I can with the world. The world might be saturated with opinions, but what is one more, with added wit and humor?</p>
<p>Did I just decide to dive back here? No. The plan this year is to certify my skills and invest in leaving a mark in whatever way possible, through small purposeful steps.  Blogging wasn&#8217;t on my radar just yet. Then came the Simple Programmer, John Sonmez. Gold lies in his blog @  <a href="http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiOTUyNDk2NiIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMTE3MTczMDEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vc2ltcGxlcHJvZ3JhbW1lci5jb20_X192aWQ9N2EzYjc2MTA3Mjg3MDEzMjg1ZmYyMjAwMGIyYTg4ZDcifQ" target="_blank">http://simpleprogrammer.com</a>. He&#8217;s putting quality content out there, through his blog and other channels, to improve the craft and lives of programmers, coders and hackers. Check him out:  http://simpleprogrammer.com/about-me/, then buy his book. Tell him recursion sent ya :). Note, I won&#8217;t win anything.</p>
<p>I visited John&#8217;s blog a few weeks back and decided to subscribe to his FREE course &#8220;<a href="http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/"><strong>How To Build A Blog That Will Boost Your Career</strong></a>&#8220;. The title seemed interesting enough and I&#8217;ve always wanted to get my blog going. I&#8217;m glad I did. It&#8217;s just the nudge I needed to get back to the code room. It&#8217;s left up to me to remain consistent but John&#8217;s advice throughout the course gives great tips to not end up suffering from writer&#8217;s block.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll reveal the theme I&#8217;ll be going with to start later. This is just a thank you, to Mr. Sonmez, for bringing some life back to &#8220;THE CODE ROOM&#8221; *echoes*</p>
<p>PS. I might not even have the best blog in my house but I&#8217;m happy Mrs. Ross is getting it done over at http://www.dajeneats.com</p>
