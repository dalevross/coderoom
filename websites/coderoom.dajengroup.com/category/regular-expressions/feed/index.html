				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the need to include in-game dictionaries for an online game I was enhancing through a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/free-tracker">Google Chrome Extension</a>.</p>
<p>When I decided to look for a simple key value pair service to load the dictionaries, I assumed I&#8217;d find loads of examples or some stable implementation that I could leverage. I found one service that appeared to not have much support and a few examples which were not quite there.</p>
<p>As I was busy with a few other things at the time, I mentioned <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> to the developer I was working with as a possible solution. I said, we might have a free solution if we manage to remain within the specified quotas. I hadn&#8217;t conceptualized the flow, so I couldn&#8217;t say whether or not that was possible. We needed to keep the price low (read zero) because the extension is free, and will always be. When a window opened up I decided to go for it.</p>
<p>First decision,</p>
<ol>
<li>Go with PHP as that is the language I&#8217;ve used most often</li>
<li>Go with Python to get more experience as I had done only a few basic example before.</li>
</ol>
<div>Easy choice, Python. Time to reduce the verbosity and get to the gold.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<h3>Step 1.</h3>
</div>
<div>Convert dictionaries to a static file that could be read quickly. I had a few failed attempts at getting good performance with</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>JSON</li>
<li><a href="http://msgpack.org/" target="_blank">msgpack </a>&#8211; It claims to be like JSON but fast and small. It still didn&#8217;t work so well for me.</li>
<li>marshal</li>
</ul>
<div>I then decided to try to implement cPickle which I&#8217;d read about before the other two but for some reason, I didn&#8217;t try it.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div class="code-embed-wrapper"> <pre class="language-python code-embed-pre"  data-start="1" data-line-offset="0"><code class="language-python code-embed-code">import sys
import re #Regular expresensions module
import cPickle


#Get all but the first argument, this script accepts a list of dictionary files
arguments = sys.argv[1:]

#For each file that you pass to the script
for filename in arguments:
    
    dictionary = {}    
    
    #Use file name without extension as dictionary name
    dictname = re.search(r&#034;\(?P&lt;dicname&gt;w+).&#034;, filename).group(&#039;dicname&#039;)

        if match is not None:
