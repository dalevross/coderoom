				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a car parked on the first floor of the City parking garage with a Z on it, in a lovely green logo.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/download.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1241" src="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/download.png" alt="download" width="225" height="225" srcset="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/download.png 225w, http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/download-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p>That Z, stands for ZipCar, not Zorro, though it feels like a sword was run against my chest when they FINALLY responded. My account was officially cancelled yesterday with no explanation. Apparently, it had been under review for some time due to, I assume, a rather revealing recording about my personality/afflictions. Anyone that truly knows me, knows how angry I can get, and a company&#8217;s bugs resulting in unfair charges, doth not help to calm one down.</p>
<p>I could go into the full story as I am an over sharer, but the story extends to other(s) who may not be comfortable with everything being out there. So I&#8217;ll stick to the pertinent facts of this engagement with a company that still needs some work.</p>
<p>Per Wikipedia, <b>Zipcar</b> is an American <a class="mw-redirect" title="Car sharing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_sharing">car-sharing</a> company and a subsidiary of <a title="Avis Budget Group" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avis_Budget_Group">Avis Budget Group</a>. Zipcar provides automobile reservations to its members, billable by the hour or day; members pay a monthly or annual membership fee in addition to car reservations charges. Zipcar was founded in 2000 by Antje Danielson and <a title="Robin Chase" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Chase">Robin Chase</a>. Interestingly, they were purchased by Avis Budget Group, on pi day 2013, the same day <a href="https://orlando.nerdnite.com/">Nerd Nite</a> was launched in Orlando (come on down this Thursday).</p>
<p>On the morning of the recording I assume resulted in the cancellation, I rented a ZC (ZipCar not <a href="http://www.zerochaos.com">ZeroChaos</a>) to get some stuff for a wild adventure away from home.</p>
<p>I had issued a test reservation on the phone earlier with a customer service agent with the clear indication that it was just a TEST transaction that I cancelled. At that time I was in a room so it would not have made sense to start the reservation as I would have lost time.</p>
<p>While at home, I had an interaction that led to me needing an extension. Image my surprise when my request was denied due to me overrunning the reservation&#8217;s end time. I called customer service and their answer was that when I attempted the second booking, I ended up rebooking the original. The problem with this theory however, is that all automated notifications indicated a later end time. This is clearly an indication of bugs that missed QA. Due to the annoyance and suggestion of late charges I went into rage mode and mentioned the police, mental illness and protection of life and property that I guess got them scared that their property might be at risk.</p>
<p>So, after weeks (maybe days, who knows) of review, I finally received this,<br />
<a href="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1231" src="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response-300x166.png" alt="zipcar_response" width="300" height="166" srcset="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response-300x166.png 300w, http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response-768x426.png 768w, http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response-624x346.png 624w, http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response.png 880w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, ZipCar has the right to do what they need to, if it is in their best interest, so no hard feelings. But to keep me in the dark as a customer, that hurt, because I loved you and still do.<br />
So, on this lovely morning, as I spend another night outside my home, (this time, just outside on the back porch) I&#8217;d just like to say, Thank you, TEAM, for everything. The lack of testing that lead to the bugs, the lack of communication skills that left me hanging, and the loss of a valuable service.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a python expert by any stretch of the imagination. When the time came to stand up and be counted for python-related <a href="https://www.meetup.com/OrlandoPython/events/234873375/">lightning talks</a> though, I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>
<p>Whenever the Facebook Hacker Cup comes around, and I happen to not miss it, I pull for trusty old python. It&#8217;s a scripting language, that I have some familiarity with, and it works well within the rules of the &#8220;cup&#8221;.</p>
<p>For the talk I discussed this and slipped in a python script I used for a dictionary service on Google App Engine (GAE) a while back.</p>
<p>The python scripts for the hacker cups since I started taking records are hosted on bitbucket in the repository linked below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reviewing potential interview questions and one intrigued me.</p>
<p>The question was to provide an  alternate way to do <a title="FizzBuzz" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">FizzBuzz</a>. I had previously done the straightforward loop method and pondered on it for a while.</p>
<p>While washing our car, I had an inspired thought that I could easily do it  with Linq. I eventually came up with  the following after getting up at about 3 am, this morning, 3/6/2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>Console.Write(string.Join("\n",Enumerable.Range(1,100).Select( number =&gt; number % 15 == 0? "FizzBuzz": number % 5
== 0? "Buzz" : number % 3 == 0 ? "Fizz" : number.ToString())).TrimEnd("\n".ToCharArray()));</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired by a past manager, Jason Bowers, who more or less planted the seeds of Clean Code in my mind,  I  continued through a bit longer. Now I don&#8217;t know if Jason approves, as I&#8217;m sure I could do more but here&#8217;s where I stopped.</p>
<pre>

class Program
{

static List&lt;Tuple&lt;int, string&gt;&gt; Divisor_FizzBuzzTuples = new List&lt;Tuple&lt;int, string&gt;&gt;();

static void Main(string[] args)
{
int rangeStart = 1;
int rangeEnd = 300;
Divisor_FizzBuzzTuples.Add(new Tuple&lt;int,string&gt;(3,"Fizz"));
Divisor_FizzBuzzTuples.Add(new Tuple&lt;int, string&gt;(5, "Buzz"));
Divisor_FizzBuzzTuples.Add(new Tuple&lt;int, string&gt;(7, "Pi"));
Divisor_FizzBuzzTuples.Add(new Tuple&lt;int, string&gt;(15, "FizzBuzz"));
Divisor_FizzBuzzTuples.Add(new Tuple&lt;int, string&gt;(21, "FizzPi"));
Divisor_FizzBuzzTuples.Add(new Tuple&lt;int, string&gt;(35, "BuzzPi"));
Divisor_FizzBuzzTuples.Add(new Tuple&lt;int, string&gt;(105, "FizzBuzzPi"));

Func&lt;int, string&gt; FizzBuzzify = i =&gt; GetFizzBuzzFromNumber(i);
var fizzBuzzList = Enumerable.Range(rangeStart, rangeEnd).Select(FizzBuzzify);
Console.Write(String.Join("\n", fizzBuzzList).TrimEnd("\n".ToCharArray()));

}

static string GetFizzBuzzFromNumber(int number)
{
string fizzbuzzornah = number.ToString();

var list = Divisor_FizzBuzzTuples.OrderByDescending(i =&gt; i.Item1);
foreach (var tuple in list)
{

<p>I was considering  adding only primes and then doing the necessary permutations but I decided to stop and work on some other outstanding stuff I had to do.</p>

It left me with a little egg on my face because I missed it.</p>

<p>Also, at the end of date night, my wife and I actually played Fizz Buzz, which she knew as Bizz Buzz from high school. She&#8217;s much better than I am but she actually helped me to relax and do better than I thought I could. With her help, I might even be able to be a Scrabble Grand Master!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I needed to get this party started, so why not do it with a little pi loving.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a die-hard pi-thusiast. I&#8217;m just a nerd who thinks that I&#8217;m the one (who knocks?) who ended up with this irrational love for a sequence of digits. Maybe it is the fact that it is the ratio of a circle&#8217;s circumference to its diameter. I don&#8217;t love circles. I don&#8217;t dislike them, but they&#8217;re just not that special. However, I think of time as a circle, I haven&#8217;t studied time but that is just what I think. History tends to repeat itself,  recurring themes and so on&#8230;.. but this post is about pi.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my pistory</p>
<ul>
<li>I memorized the digits of pi from my calculator in high school. I think at the time this was 3.141592654 rounded.</li>
<li>During an electronics lecture at the University of the West Indies, the lecturer asked the class to state the digits of pi. Oooooh, my time to shiiiiiiiineeee! Some stopped after 2 digits, some after four and Sir Dale (I&#8217;ve been knighted) of course went valiantly through his 10 digits :3<br />
<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><a style="clear: left; display: inline !important; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;" href="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/obamas-not-bad.png"><img src="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/obamas-not-bad-300x114.png" alt="" width="320" height="121" border="0" /></a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">Not bad, Mr. Ross</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>Of course, this drew attention, and the lecturer asked me to repeat, I think. He then went on to recite about 30 or so digits.<br />
<table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;" href="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/areyoukiddingme.png"><img src="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/areyoukiddingme-300x114.png" alt="" width="320" height="121" border="0" /></a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">Are you kidding me, seriously?!</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>I made a deal with the lecturer to receive imaginary marks if I could get to 100 digits by the end of the course.</li>
<li>On my final exam I included the following (I could only remember 93 while doing the post but it might be due to code-induced-insomnia). I Googled (<i>3.5-1.5 on the Bing test</i>) the other 8 digits, sue me! No, please don&#8217;t!<br />
<blockquote><p>3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510<br />
582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706798</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>That&#8217;s <b>101 digits</b>, because stopping at 100 would have required rounding and that&#8217;s not cool, man. I got my imaginary marks but they only reported the real component, claiming it was too complex! The nerve!<br />
