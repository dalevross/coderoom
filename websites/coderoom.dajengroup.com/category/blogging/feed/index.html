				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I write this, I am sitting on the edge of my bed listening to my older brother snore. We&#8217;re both crashing at our parents&#8217; home in Bronx, NY. I initially planned to spend a couple of weeks, but the more I think about where things stand, with my finances, mental state and goals, I might be here a while. Just a few nights ago, I was in an AirBnB location, jobless (by choice) and not 100% sure of what the next step would be.</p>
<p>My boss at Zero Chaos, on my last day, told me to listen to &#8220;Empire State of Mind&#8221; as soon as a landed. Technically, I drove into NY, in my sisters car while she held on for dear life. I think I finally realized why I have such a fascination with Germany. I want to go 314 mph on the AutoBahn!!</p>
<p>This was the end state though, so let&#8217;s rewind to the beginning of the end. After 5.4+ years, my wife and I are trying a new thing. Neither of us knows definitely what the future holds and there is, mostly, nothing but admiration and awe of the tremendous potential that exists individually in each of us. Dajen Eats is the business! (Irie Cream, Irie On The Go, Exclusively Irie).</p>
<p>At the end of it, we decided she&#8217;d keep the apartment and the dogs and I, being a bad ass software engineer, would get something new, somewhere. With my amazing life skills I ended up on the most amazing ride which led me to paragraph 1.</p>
<p>In the early days there was the whole Aloft experience where I had money, my sister had money but a physical card was not present to book a room. [This was after the whole incident at ZC where I apparently said too much to someone and made them uncomfortable. I still find it confounding that, while uncomfortable, the individual still chose to give their full, easily searchable name. Had I actually been a predator, that bit of info would potentially be dangerous. I accept that I was only on one end of the conversation and that I cannot decide on another&#8217;s discomfort.]  All this happened because I was holding out on a specific AirBnB and it didn&#8217;t work out. I even did the whole &#8220;AirBnB-ing while black&#8221; thing to resolve the lack of a response in my mind. Apparently, however, there was an event that weekend and I just chose the wrong time to be &#8220;homeless&#8221;.</p>

<p>I then had the most amazing journey through the mean streets of Orlando, making friends with the most nefario&#8230;..lies. I then got to meet an array of beautiful souls, who when combined, showed me that there is indeed love in the world.</p>
<p>AirBnB House 1 &#8211; https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/26026771<br />
Host: Keith<br />
Things were great here and I found true brothers that will have a lasting impact. I also met Germans, an Argentinian, a Czech, and more I&#8217;m sure. There was a downside but that I will handle and not mention anything further. Keith, EW and TJ, respect!</p>
<p>AirBnB  House 2 &#8211; https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/7861291<br />
Host: Jessie (the motivation for this post)<br />
She had Germany in her profile, I needed to learn more. Cost-wise this was comparative to Keith&#8217;s pad but with improved security to protect against what took place somewhere else. Once I got in, I knew it would be good, just not as freakishly amazing as it got. I vibe on co-incidences  and synchronicity and they were just everywhere!</p>
<p>1. We share a birthday!</p>
<p><a href="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/birthday.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1301" src="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/birthday-169x300.png" alt="" width="169" height="300" srcset="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/birthday-169x300.png 169w, http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/birthday.png 478w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a></p>

The <strong>amazing guests</strong> including about 73% Asians (61% Chinese) [Those are made up stats based on guesswork, I didn&#8217;t count the people, that would be weird.].  I was even invited to join an amazing couple and their friends for a night I&#8217;ll never forget.</p>
<p>Then Jamie herself, who made me feel all tingly inside, not in the way that would be assumed by such a sentiment but in a way I only feel when things are going right (universally speaking). I cannot confirm or deny if she also made me consider proposing on day 1, because that would be weird.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it doesn&#8217;t always take cash to care. For Aloft it does, with the physical card present and I couldn&#8217;t stay in the lounge for too long, because &#8220;loitering&#8221;. However, Jamie cared and let me crash on her couch my last few nights when my cash was way in the red thanks to a big heart and delusions of an infinite money bag.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/download.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1241" src="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/download.png" alt="download" width="225" height="225" srcset="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/download.png 225w, http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/download-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p>That Z, stands for ZipCar, not Zorro, though it feels like a sword was run against my chest when they FINALLY responded. My account was officially cancelled yesterday with no explanation. Apparently, it had been under review for some time due to, I assume, a rather revealing recording about my personality/afflictions. Anyone that truly knows me, knows how angry I can get, and a company&#8217;s bugs resulting in unfair charges, doth not help to calm one down.</p>
<p>I could go into the full story as I am an over sharer, but the story extends to other(s) who may not be comfortable with everything being out there. So I&#8217;ll stick to the pertinent facts of this engagement with a company that still needs some work.</p>
<p>Per Wikipedia, <b>Zipcar</b> is an American <a class="mw-redirect" title="Car sharing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_sharing">car-sharing</a> company and a subsidiary of <a title="Avis Budget Group" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avis_Budget_Group">Avis Budget Group</a>. Zipcar provides automobile reservations to its members, billable by the hour or day; members pay a monthly or annual membership fee in addition to car reservations charges. Zipcar was founded in 2000 by Antje Danielson and <a title="Robin Chase" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Chase">Robin Chase</a>. Interestingly, they were purchased by Avis Budget Group, on pi day 2013, the same day <a href="https://orlando.nerdnite.com/">Nerd Nite</a> was launched in Orlando (come on down this Thursday).</p>
<p>On the morning of the recording I assume resulted in the cancellation, I rented a ZC (ZipCar not <a href="http://www.zerochaos.com">ZeroChaos</a>) to get some stuff for a wild adventure away from home.</p>
<p>I had issued a test reservation on the phone earlier with a customer service agent with the clear indication that it was just a TEST transaction that I cancelled. At that time I was in a room so it would not have made sense to start the reservation as I would have lost time.</p>
<p>While at home, I had an interaction that led to me needing an extension. Image my surprise when my request was denied due to me overrunning the reservation&#8217;s end time. I called customer service and their answer was that when I attempted the second booking, I ended up rebooking the original. The problem with this theory however, is that all automated notifications indicated a later end time. This is clearly an indication of bugs that missed QA. Due to the annoyance and suggestion of late charges I went into rage mode and mentioned the police, mental illness and protection of life and property that I guess got them scared that their property might be at risk.</p>
<p>So, after weeks (maybe days, who knows) of review, I finally received this,<br />
<a href="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1231" src="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response-300x166.png" alt="zipcar_response" width="300" height="166" srcset="http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response-300x166.png 300w, http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response-768x426.png 768w, http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response-624x346.png 624w, http://coderoom.dajengroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/zipcar_response.png 880w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, ZipCar has the right to do what they need to, if it is in their best interest, so no hard feelings. But to keep me in the dark as a customer, that hurt, because I loved you and still do.<br />
So, on this lovely morning, as I spend another night outside my home, (this time, just outside on the back porch) I&#8217;d just like to say, Thank you, TEAM, for everything. The lack of testing that lead to the bugs, the lack of communication skills that left me hanging, and the loss of a valuable service.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I decided to redo my resume. I decided to head over to hacker news to see if I could find a cool hacker way to get it done. As my wife &#8220;<a title="Irie Happy Vegan" href="http://www.dajeneats.com" target="_blank">The Irie Happy Vegan</a>&#8221; would say, I needed to find a bulldozer to kill this fly. I saw a post that I had come across before about <a href="https://jsonresume.org/" target="_blank">jsonresume</a>.  I decided to take it for a spin and thought it was pretty neat.</p>
<p>Well, here is the JSON repo: https://github.com/dalevross/jsonresume<br />
Elegant theme: <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross" target="_blank">http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross</a><br />
Other themes <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=paper" target="_blank">Paper</a>, <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=kendall" target="_blank">Kendall</a>, <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=flat" target="_blank">Flat</a>, <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=modern" target="_blank">Modern</a>, <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=classy" target="_blank">Classy</a>, <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=class" target="_blank">Class</a>, <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=short" target="_blank">Short</a>, <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=slick" target="_blank">Slick</a>, <a href="http://registry.jsonresume.org/dalevross?theme=kwan" target="_blank">Kwan</a></p>
<p>I decided to play around with Camtasia a little bit and figured this was a great thing to talk about and a good time to talk about it.</p>
<p>So, here is my quick and fairly clean review of jsonresume.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Code Room has been in existence for quite some time. It was intended to be, as the headline stated,<br />
&#8220;<em>A code snippet archive, how-i-did-its, some corny jokes and a look into the <strong>mind of recursion</strong>. I prefer lines of code to lines of blog text so this ride might be a little wild. Just come along though, and maybe we&#8217;ll see something great.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Some code did make it to the blog, which was then hosted on blogger, but it never did get the investment it deserved. For as long as I&#8217;ve known how to, I&#8217;ve been in love with writing code. The language was never an issue, and I&#8217;ve joked that I eat learning curves for breakfast. Something changed over the years though. Complacency set in, I continued to hack here and there, and the world moved ahead while my skills stayed a few paces back from where they could be.</p>
<p>This is the year I change that though, I will invest in my craft and I&#8217;ll share what I can with the world. The world might be saturated with opinions, but what is one more, with added wit and humor?</p>
<p>Did I just decide to dive back here? No. The plan this year is to certify my skills and invest in leaving a mark in whatever way possible, through small purposeful steps.  Blogging wasn&#8217;t on my radar just yet. Then came the Simple Programmer, John Sonmez. Gold lies in his blog @  <a href="http://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiOTUyNDk2NiIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiMTE3MTczMDEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vc2ltcGxlcHJvZ3JhbW1lci5jb20_X192aWQ9N2EzYjc2MTA3Mjg3MDEzMjg1ZmYyMjAwMGIyYTg4ZDcifQ" target="_blank">http://simpleprogrammer.com</a>. He&#8217;s putting quality content out there, through his blog and other channels, to improve the craft and lives of programmers, coders and hackers. Check him out:  http://simpleprogrammer.com/about-me/, then buy his book. Tell him recursion sent ya :). Note, I won&#8217;t win anything.</p>
<p>I visited John&#8217;s blog a few weeks back and decided to subscribe to his FREE course &#8220;<a href="http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/"><strong>How To Build A Blog That Will Boost Your Career</strong></a>&#8220;. The title seemed interesting enough and I&#8217;ve always wanted to get my blog going. I&#8217;m glad I did. It&#8217;s just the nudge I needed to get back to the code room. It&#8217;s left up to me to remain consistent but John&#8217;s advice throughout the course gives great tips to not end up suffering from writer&#8217;s block.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll reveal the theme I&#8217;ll be going with to start later. This is just a thank you, to Mr. Sonmez, for bringing some life back to &#8220;THE CODE ROOM&#8221; *echoes*</p>
<p>PS. I might not even have the best blog in my house but I&#8217;m happy Mrs. Ross is getting it done over at http://www.dajeneats.com</p>
